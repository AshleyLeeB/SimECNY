### IV. Data Relationships


1. Opening Module and Transaction Module:
   - Linked through wallet_id
   - The src and dst fields in the transaction module correspond to wallet_id in the opening module
   - The src_wallet_level and dst_wallet_level in the transaction module correspond to wallet_level in the opening module

2. Opening Module and Closure Module:
   - Linked through wallet_id
   - The wallet_id in the closure module corresponds to wallet_id in the opening module
   - The wallet_open_tel in the closure module corresponds to wallet_open_tel in the opening module

3. Transaction Module and Closure Module:
   - Indirectly linked through wallet_id
   - Closure time should be later than the wallet's last transaction time in the transaction module
